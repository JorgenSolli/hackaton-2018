## Spicy Trips
Flights do not need only to about getting from point A to point B as soon as possible. I should also be about utilising the opportunity to experience something new along the way.

Spicy Trips focuses on the time between flights and gives the user an option to choose an extended travel time with fewer hours spent in the air, thus having more hours experiencing a new country or city.
